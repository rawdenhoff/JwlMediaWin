# ZoomSwitcher <img src="https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/iflm7hmfrl4ffqjw?svg=true">

Utility to hide the media window for Zoom and JW Library.

To avoid having to drag the secondary output window for these two apps manually across to the secondary monitor, this utility can temporarily hide whichever one is not needed, thus simplifying the process to switch between them.
